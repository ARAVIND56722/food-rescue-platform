## 🎯 Problem Statement

Large amounts of surplus food from hotels and events go to waste, while orphanages and shelters struggle to get regular meals. There is no simple, transparent platform to connect donors with NGOs and volunteers in real time.

---

## 💡 Solution

The Food Rescue Platform provides a centralized system where:

* Donors can post surplus food
* NGOs can review and accept food donations
* Volunteers can pick up and deliver food
* Orphanages can request meals and track delivery status

All stakeholders interact through a **single live web application**.
